These are files from a class in Java Programming I took at UC Berkeley Extension Summer of 1997 from Allen Holub.

Note that there are documentation files in ClarisWorks format. The strings are pretty easy to extract. The pictures were converted by me to .png files back then; I have no idea how they match up with the ClarisWorks files they came from.

This is Java 1.2 code. Shudder.
